Documentation

For this project I used the stack I am more comfortable with, which is:

- React with Typescript for the logic
- Bootstrap (react)

I approached the project the folling way:

- First of all I researched a little bit about pricing cards to find out what role they play in a product, to find out it's a pretty relevant part of it. For example that the order in which the cards are presented have an influence in the visitors decision making; also the amount of information that is displayed or the colors.
- Anyways, after getting to know the basics of that kind of features, I started observing the design and thinking of its features.
- On thing I did notice was that the the proportions of each card were different and there was no harmony. The first imporvements I would take into account:

* Making margins of each card equal, and also their porportions.
* Making buttons the same width.
* Adding shadows on each card to make them a bit more 3-dimentional.

For the card content, since they all had the same structure but different text, I created an array of 3 objects, one for each pricing plan and then mapped through it to create the cards with the content.

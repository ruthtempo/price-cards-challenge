Documentation

For this project I used the stack I am more comfortable with, which is:

- React with Typescript for the logic
- Bootstrap (react)

I approached the project the folling way:

- First of all I researched a little bit about pricing cards to find out what role they play in a product, to find out it's a pretty relevant part of it. For example that the order in which the cards are presented have an influence in the visitors decision making; also the amount of information that is displayed or the colors.
- Anyways, after getting to know the basics of that kind of features, I started thinking of the best way to display the elements and interact with them.
- On thing I did not notice at first sight was that the proportions of each card were different, and also their margins or button widths. That was something to fix and make more harmonic.
